# Graph Editor in C++: Building a Virtual World

## Introduction
**Graph Editor in C++** is an advanced project aimed at creating a virtual environment from scratch, akin to complex simulations like Pok√©mon Go. This is a C++ conversion of an original JavaScript-based project by Dr.Radu, detailed in [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iHejdqYIa8). The project incorporates a wide array of skills including mathematics, algorithms, programming, and design. It's a comprehensive toolkit for those looking to understand the intricacies behind modern software interfaces, game development, and simulation design.

## Key Features
- **Spatial Graph Editor**: Build and edit a spatial graph with a dynamic viewport, laying the foundation for complex virtual worlds.
- **Mathematics and Logic of UI**: Delve into the mathematics and logic that make software interfaces user-friendly and intuitive.
- **3D World Generation**: Use geometry to generate road borders, buildings, and trees, creating a 3D-like environment.
- **Advanced Road and Traffic Simulation**: Implement road markings and set up environments for simulating self-driving car challenges.
- **Auto-Generation and Customization**: Enhance the world editor to maximize auto-generated content while allowing detailed customization.
- **Real-World Data Integration**: Load and manipulate real-world data from sources like OpenStreetMap for realistic city simulations.
- **Navigational Tools**: Create a minimap and other navigation aids for ease of movement in expansive virtual worlds.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
- CMake
- Graphics and UI libraries suitable for C++ (OpenGL, SFML, etc.)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/JacobDrizzle/Graph_Editor.git

css
Copy code
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd Graph_Editor

arduino
Copy code
3. Build the project using CMake:
cmake .
make

csharp
Copy code

## Usage
Run the built executable to launch the Graph Editor. The application allows you to create and edit virtual environments, with tools for building roads, structures, and landscapes. Experiment with different aspects of the environment to understand the underlying mathematics and algorithms.
